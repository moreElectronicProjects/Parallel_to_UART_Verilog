# Parallel to UART adapter

This contains the Verilog code to implement a parallel to UART adapter. Additionally, there is a Logisim Evolution project which simulates the circuit implemented in the Verilog code.

# Using the code

The only requirement to use the Verilog code is the synthesis tool needs to support the ``` $clog2 ``` instruction.

To open the Logisim Evolution project, Logisim Evolution is required.
